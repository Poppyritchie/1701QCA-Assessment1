### Experiment name ###

Experiment 6: Setting the tone with a piezo buzzer

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was a frequency of 400Hz is the pin going from low to high 400 times in one second. I also learnt after it not working the first time always double check placement and condition of the jumper wire, as I had to replace one for it started working. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as any kind of device that requires a buzzer such as alarm devices and timers.

Experiment 7: Wind power

Wind power breadboard 

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the contribution of R1 and R2 on the breadboard. Together the form a divider which halves the volage from the motor which keeps it in the measurable range which is a number between 0-1023

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as wind energy which is used by wind to provide the mechanical power to turn electric generators.

### Experiment name ###

Experiment 3: Dimming and LED using a potentiometer 

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

Dimming an LED breadboard

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was that the R1 and the LED have to be the exact same way as the diagram otherwise it won't work. For example, the LED has to have the flat side on the right and the R1 has to have the yellow band on the left.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as normal house lights that have the on and off switch and the ability to dim darker and lighter.

### Experiment name ###

Experiment 4: Using a transistor to drive a motor 

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

Transistor to drive a motor breadboard

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the codes two stages of increasing and reducing the duty value. For example, it increases the duty to one and writes the value to P0 repeatly until the maximum of 1023.

This experiment could be the basis of a many real world application such as fans, power tools, aircon. Many electrical things require a motor in the real life.
