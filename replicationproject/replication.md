# Assessment 1: Replication project

*Fill out the following workbook with information relevant to your project.*

*Markdown reference:* [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Replication project choice ##
Banana keyboard 

## Related projects ##
*Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the* `replicationproject` *folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing, updating the number* `1` *in the subtitle for each.*

### Related project 1 ###
Touch Board

https://www.bareconductive.com/make/introducing-the-touch-board/

![Image](Touch board)

This project is related to mine because firstly the board plays certain sounds depending on what is touch. My project and the touch board both have a similar function as they are both trigger by touch which then plays audio from speakers. Although the touch board has a different connection element as they use a electric Paint pen. 

### Related project 2 ###
Pringles drum kit

https://www.instructables.com/id/Pringle-Can-MIDI-Drums/

The pringles drum kit is related to mine with materials and function. The both banana's and pringles are materials that are household objects, the play a fun and interesting part in the project. This projects also plays sounds by touch circuit this is obviously the main function in the banana keyboard also. 

### Related project 3 ###
Coke piano 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttm62RBdOuo

The coke piano is comparable to the banana keyboard as they are both clearly the same instrument with sound projecting from it. Again it has the same function and materials, as the coke cans are a unusual but exciting part of the project, this also reflects the banana keyboard. 


## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

The main source that helped me majorly with my project was youtube videos and other similar projects like the touch board. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_kbW2-qksw
This youtube video was help getting started with coding and basically wrapping my head around how it performs. Although this video doesn't seem very credential it still gave me an idea on how to put it together in the beginnning. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&v=GEpZrvbsO7o&feature=emb_title
This youtube video was found on the microbit website for the banana keyboard. This video gave me an in-depth understanding of the circuit and the more technical side of the project. Although the outcome and coding didn't represent what I was trying to achieve it had very similar function and circuit. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtDZ3fYyUN0
This was an bit of an inspiration and understanding touch sensitive circuit. It also has a similar function and piano sounds to the banana keyboard. 

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###
Banana Keyboard 
### Project description ###
The banana keyboard is a fun way to play with sound or music and learning the basics of tones and beats. The banana keyword can be altered with any conductive fruit for example; oranges, lime, lemon, grapfruit. The idea is of this keyboard is to explore sound with a touch trigger and uncommon objects. This project is for anyone that enjoys sound or music but especially the younger people that like a silly but educational project.  

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*
